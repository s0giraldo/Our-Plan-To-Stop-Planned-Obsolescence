    <h1>Standardising Charging Policy</h1>
    <p>Companies design their products to increase demand by making chargers that require users to buy new plugs, or an adapter.</p>
    <p>This means there is so much more unnecessary wastage and consumption.</p>
    <p>USB-C should become the standard charging port across all brands.</p>
    <p>In 2020 alone, there was a global total of 54 million tons of e-waste accumulated.</p>
