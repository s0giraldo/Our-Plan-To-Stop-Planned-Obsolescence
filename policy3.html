    <h1>Harmful Chemicals in Electronic Devices</h1>
    <p>Electronics nowadays contain many harmful chemical substances. Such dangerous chemicals may be released during use. The main toxic metal substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium, zinc and nickel. Other toxic substances are brominated flame retardants, antimony trioxide, halogenated flame retardants, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and phthalates.</p>
    <h1>Metals</h1>
    <h2>Lead</h2>
    <p>Lead could cause lead poisoning. Victims of lead poisoning could experience symptoms  such as abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems and tingling in hands and feet.</p>
    <p>The consequences of lead poisoning could be permanent. The worst cases could lead to anemia, seizures, coma or death.</p>
    <h2>Mercury</h2>
    <p>Mercury poisoning can cause permanent lung damage, potential brain damage, kidney damage, cause blood loss and even damage to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).</p>
    <p>Large amounts of mercury or long-term exposure can lead to death if not treated. Workers at electronic device manufacturing companies are therefore at a higher risk of experiencing the consequences of mercury poisoning.</p>
    <h2>Nickel</h2>
    <p>Nickel poisoning could cause headaches, contact dermatitis, gastrointestinal and respiratory manisfestations.</p>
    <p>Potential diseases due to nickel could be lung and nasal cancer, cardiovascular diseases and lung fibrosis. In severe cases, large amounts of nickel in the human body could even cause death.</p>
    <h1>Flame Retardants</h1>
    <p>Studies have shown that neurological damage, hormone disruption, cancer and other chronic health problems could be caused by flame retardants. In severe cases, it could eventually lead to death.</p>
    <h1>Polyvinyl Chlorine (PVC)</h1>
    <h2>Toxic Chemicals</h2>
    <p>During the use of PVC plastic, it releases toxic chlorine-based chemicals. The chemicals include dioxins that are among the main toxic chemicals identified.</p>
    <h2>Harmful Effects</h2>
    <p>PVC exposure could lead to an increased risk to some liver cancers such as hepatic angiosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, brain and lung cancers, lymphoma and leukemia.</p>
    <h1>Phthalates</h1>
    <h2>Possible Effects on Health</h2>
    <p>Exposure to phthalates is shown to have great correlation to an increased risk of prenatal mortality, reduced growth and birth weight, and many other harmful health effects.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <h2>Policy</h2>
    <p>Laws and regulations on chemicals in electronics ought to be imposed in order to protect both workers' and users' health.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>New York has banned organhalogen flame retardants in electronic displays. It is important other countries do so as well.</p>
