    <h1>Our Plan to Stop Planned Obsolescence:</h1>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Dictionary definition: a policy of producing consumer goods that rapidly become obsolete and so require replacing, achieved by frequent changes in design, termination of the supply of spare parts, and the use of non-durable materials.</p>
    <h2>Why is this bad?</h2>
    <p>Effects: Social and Cultural</p>
    <p>The digital divide is exacerbated by these practices as it leaves poorer or older people at a disadvantage as they can't keep up with the latest updates.</p>
    <p>This directly affects people's work options as, increasingly, the world of work requires electronic devices, specifically, working from home, which was necessity during times of lockdown due to COVID.</p>
